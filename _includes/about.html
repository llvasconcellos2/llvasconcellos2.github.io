          Championing backend and frontend integration, my tenure as a Software
          Engineer at Email on Acid showcases a commitment to modernizing legacy
          systems with marked performance enhancements. The transformation of
          cloud applications through meticulous refactoring has underscored my
          career. My technical fluency extends to Node.js and Angular, driving
          the development of scalable, readable code. Partnering with
          multinational teams, our collaborative efforts have elevated software
          solutions, catering to clients like Doctors Without Borders and Tribal
          Group, leveraging my proficiency in English and Portuguese.
